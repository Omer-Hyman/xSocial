Welcome to xSocial!
A project I started during my final year of university and continue to work on to this day.

It is an application which hopes to bring Skateboarders together, providing a social platform that allows them to find areas where they can skateboard whereever they may be.

I hope to get this app to a point where different users can add spots to the map interface, including details like physical features present and pictures. Additionally, I am to build a social aspect where other users can leave comments and interact with each other.

To run the frontend, run Ionic serve in the frontend directory.
To run the backend server, run py manage.py runserver in the backend directory.
